 Hello to all! This is Kei from Biomedical Science. I had been studying in Hong Kong for two years and am glad to be a member of the Scholarship team. Ever since I started university life in City U, I tried to make the most out of it. Not only studying but also volunteering, participating in student association and department activities but so on. And now, I am dreaming to become a scientist on cancer therapy. I know that university life, especially studying aboard, is not as easy as it seems. There will be times of ups and downs; academics, experiences and relationships. But I know I have learned so much from it. And I believe we can always learn to be smarter and stronger, together! Hope I can also be a good Wuddy friend of you. Best wishes.

Hey Wuddies, I am Aleydis Kinkie,a year 3 student majoring in Civil Engineering. People usually mistake me for a local because of my Chinese looking face. However, I come from Indonesia and it is too bad that I cannot speak Mandarin or Cantonese. As an International student, it is common tofeel homesick, but living in Hall 9 for two semesters made me realize that Hall 9 is a second home away from home. Honestly, I did not pick Hall 9 as I was simply placed here by SRO. But as time passed, I couldn't think of any other halls to live in other than Hall 9 because I feel like I belong here. The fact that wuddies are really active, nice, and friendly and that the activities are fun and interesting made me actively participate in and contribute to many different events. With the pleasure and honor
of being a scholarship recipient, this is the kind of Hall 9 that I want to contribute to while balancing life and academics.

Hello everyone! I am Ng Chak Hei, Felix, a final year student of Bachelor of Social Sciences in Criminology. During my stay in Hall 9 last year, I joined different kinds of hall activities. For example, I joined the floor decoration competition and food cooking competition with my floor mates as a team. I was also a PEK competition cheering team member and one of the journalists for our Hall Year Book. I joined as many activities as I could to broaden my horizons as well as contributing to Hall 9. Those hall activities I joined not only created a good social bonding between me and my hall mates, they also brought me a warm and memorable residential experience. Apart from joining the hall activities, I also tried my best to maintain academic excellence by spending time on getting prepared for classes and doing revision. I have always wanted to fulfill the Hall 9 spirit by being a loving, caring and inspiring person in different ways. This year, I am honored to be a member of the Hall 9 Scholarship Team and I will try my best to help Hall 9 residents accomplish a better academic performance. Hope all of you will enjoy your stay here!

Hi Wuddies, I am XIE Zhilin, Katherine, a year 3 student majoring in Computer Science. I feel pleased to be part of hall 9 and I have participated in as many activities as possible to truly engage in the residence life, including High Table Dinner, Wuddies Party, Poon Choi Feast and the Sedan Chair Race. I have been the floor representative in 3th floor and organized several joint-floor activities to create a sense of bond and belonging among residents. Apart from joining in various activities, I did well in academic performance and was placed on the Dean's List. I believe the colorful residence life refreshes and enriches myself and inspires me to keep on going. As a member of Hall 9 scholarship team, I promise to try my best to make contribution to the academy and harmony of Hall 9 in the future.

Hello Wuddies! I am Benjamin, KO Tsun Hon. I am a final year student majoring in Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management. This is also my fourth year living in Hall 9! In these three years, I joined almost all the events held by the Residence Association, Hall tutor, and Student Residence Office. There are so many fruitful experience and good memories. I am also one of the core team member of the hall swimming team and last year we got 3rd-runner-up in the event! These events enrich my hall life so much and I enjoy making new friends in our hall. Besides, I was awarded the Dean's List during 2017/18 Semester A. It is my honor to be a member of the Hall Scholarships Team this year. As a member of the team, I would try my best to help Hall 9 to maintain a good learning environment and improving our hall's academic performance. Hope all Wuddies enjoy living in Hall 9 and perform well in your academic life!

Hello Wuddies! I am BIAN Zheng Rudolf, a year 3 student majoring in Finance. The coming semester would be my third year in Hall 9. Over the past two years, I have participated in many activities that gather residents together to enrich our university life. Furthermore, apart from only being a participant, I acted as an organizer to hold two students-initialized activities encouraging residents to hang out and explore the natural beauty of Hong Kong. Despite colorful residence life, my academic performance is good as well. I am also horned to become a student intern in Research Centre for Sustainable Hong Kong to research on Islamic Finance. Overall, it is my great pleasure to be selected as a member of Hall Scholar Team and contribute more to our Hall 9 in all aspects in the future. Players come and go, but the club's light remains forever. Wish Hall 9 would be a haven of peace and a road to excellence for all of us!

Hi Wuddies, I am XU Guangchen, Osborn, a year 4 student with accounting major. This is my fourth year in hall 9 and I am very proud that I can be one member in this hall. I like and always take an active part in the hall activities, such as the high table dinner, Poon Choi Feast and PEK activities. It is my pleasure to make contribution as much as possible for our hall. Every year when there is floor decoration activity, I make an example as the floor representative to join it and help our floor look nice and warm. In academic aspect, I performed well every semester and would like to help my hallmates with any problems in study. Next year, I will continue living in hall 9 and continue trying my best to make contribution to the community. Assisting the hall master and hall team to build a harmonious atmosphere will be the most important responsibility for me.
