<B>A Philanthropic Race – 2015 Sedan Chair Race & Bazaar</B></center><br>


A gleaming sunshine fell on the morning of 25th of October and reminded us – it’s time for the 41st Sedan Chair Race & Bazaar! This is the second year CityU Hall 9 joining this meaningful event. It’s a charity event created by Nurse Joyce Smith with dual purposes to promote the Matilda International Hospital while raising money for needy charities which are not funded by the government and well off private sectors. Starting from 1975, the tradition passed on and attracted more than 45 running teams and 2000 visitors to participate in this meaningful event. 
<br><br>
In the morning when we arrived at the hustle and bustle Peak, people from all walks of life dressed up and teamed up for the 2.1 km route race. This year, for our Hall 9, the theme was ‘The Nutcracker’. The princess came with a fabulous blue dress sitting on the Sedan Chair and all the nutcrackers in red coats with tall black hats carried her from start to end. Everyone was cheering for their team through shouting their slogans, singing their theme songs and dancing with the rhythm. Our hall captured the audience by unitedly demonstrating our hall beat “Upperlele! Hall9 Hall9 Bomba!”, which boosted our morale and we could finally complete the race in thunderous applause. 
<br><br>
And congratulation! Our hall won the 1st runner up of Best Decorated Chair out of 45 teams!

<B>Mission Statement – We Love and We Care</B><br>
by Sir Gordon and Lady Ivy Wu Hall, City University of Hong Kong<br><br></center>

Sir Gordon and Lady Ivy Wu Hall, as one of the eleven student halls in the residence community of the City University of Hong Kong, aims to provide with its student residents an atmosphere of love and care. We nurture our community to be filled with love and compassion. We want to extend this love and compassion to the bigger Hong Kong society, particularly those underprivileged people. We are ready to take the team race challenge in the 40th anniversary of the Sedan Chair Charity Event, as organised by the Sedan Chair Charities Fund, to raise donation for people in need of help. We call for your support.<br><br>
The Sedan Chair Race is an annual event organised by the Sedan Chair Charities Fund, with its aim to raise charity money for charitable organisations that generally do not receive assistance from the Hong Kong Community Chest, Hong Kong Jockey Club or the Government. These are the smaller groups of people that needed help from the society, but are not large enough to draw the proper attention and concern.  Such minority groups could be children being abused in their family up-bringing, children that face learning difficulties, the unfortunate long term disease sufferers, families from the minorities, workers who are on a more taboo subject, such as drug rehabilitation and generally the people that have fallen in their hard times but are often overlooked by the society. <br><br>
Sir Gordon and Lady Ivy Wu Hall is very concerned about this, and we want to take the challenge in this well-known Sedan Chair Race to raise concern and funds for these people in need. We want to show that we love, and we care to these people, and we want to cultivate in our students this compassion in heart that essentially sets the bedrock for our society.<br><br>
