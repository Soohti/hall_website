 Hello Wuddies! I am Jingle, WANG Jing, a year 3 student majoring in Information Engineering, and this is already my third year in Hall 9. Over the last two years, I have actively participated in hall activities like Wuddies' Party, High Table Dinner andBasketball Competition. Except participating in hall activities, I’m also a floor representative of 4th floor. By cooperating with other floor representatives, I have contributed a lot to enrich the hall lives for our floor-mates. I’m also a member of Hall 9 Media and Communication Team, responsible for the design of one part of hall year book, and I make every effort to complete my work. Though participating in many activities, I still keep a good academic performance. I was awarded the Dean's List during the last year. It is my great pleasure to be a member of Hall Scholarships Team this year. In this year, I will continue participating in various hall 9 activities and make more contribution to lead the Hall9 residents to pursue the academic excellence in Hall 9.

My name is Likang WANG. I am in my 4 th year, majoring in Energy Science and Engineering at School of Energy and Environment. I have been living in Hall 9 since I came to City University. During these years, I have been encouraged to strive for both excellent academic performances and social engagement. Hall activities serve as a delightful medium to our inspiring university life. I was acting as floor representative in my Year 3 and was a member of Hall Basketball Team. Other activities such as Poon Choi Feast, Joint Hall Gala Dinner and Career Evening could also enrich our hall life. My hall experiences have also inspired me in many other perspectives including job interviews, community services and interpersonal communication, since I have learned more about Hong Kong customs and cultures here. These wonderful hall experiences are getting me more confident to embrace my future life in Hong Kong.

 Hello! I am Iris, a year-3 student studying Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management. It is my third year living in Hall 9. This place gives me opportunity to explore and learn new things for example I was one of the previous residence association members who took up responsibility to organize activities like cooking competition, tuck-shop etc. so as to gather Wuddies as one. The most memorable activity this year is the joint hall orientation camp. I had much fun playing games with freshmen and met a lot of new friends. Moreover, I challenged myself by joining Singing Contest in Professor Edmond Ko Cup last year. I did not know how to dance before joining the competition. After practicing hard with hall mates, I was brave enough to be on stage and perform. With good time management, I am able to strike a balance between study and having a fruitful hall life.

Hi, I’m Amber, Hao Zixun, a final year student studying Culture and Heritage Management. I have attended the Aquatic Competition of PEK twice, the Sedan Chair Design and numerous intrahall and interhall events in the previous three years. It might amaze you that this is my fourth year living in Hall 9 and it definitely amazed me, for the bounty of the residence committee and amiable atmosphere of the hall. Sharing the hall life with all the Wuddies is one of the most worthwhile and fulfilling experiences in my uni-life. It is also my great pleasure to be one of the recipients of the hall scholarship this year. In the scholarship team, I am responsible of the career chat room event in the upcoming semester. I will do my best in my last year in Hall 9 to commit more to its nurturing atmosphere, and hope we can share a fruitful and happy life in hall!

Hello everyone! I am LAI Yimin, Ariel, a year 3 student majoring in Applied Biology, and this is already my third year in Hall 9. Last year I was the floor representative in 11th floor, mainly helping the tutor to organize the floor meeting and floor activities. And in the past two years, I was also one of the hall team members actively participating in the PEK inter-hall Table Tennis and Badminton competitions, in which our hall team members paid great effort together and won the prize of at least the second runner-up. In these competition events, by the encouragement and help from wuddies, I truly felt the belongingness in living in Hall 9, making these events become my unforgettable memories. In addition to the inter-hall PEK competitions, there are also many interesting activities held in Hall 9, such as the Woodies Party and Poon-Choi Feast. Hope all of you could enjoy the activities and the residential life in Hall 9 and perform well in your academic life as well!

Hey people, I’m Mickey Jane Salim, a year 3 student majoring in Marketing Information Management. I am named after the famous Mickey Mouse because my parents love Disney so much and I was born in mouse year according to the Chinese calendar. Technically speaking, I am Chinese but my family and I were born and raised in Indonesia, therefore, sadly, we can speak neither Chinese nor Cantonese. For me, as an international student, hall 9 is my home in Hong Kong. I’m glad that I chose this hall because the Wuddies are really welcome and friendly. They help me cure my homesick, allow me to contribute to hall activities more than I expected and become my second family. As an extrovert, my source of energy is meeting new people, that’s why I tried to join a lot of activities both in campus and student residence but I won’t go into the boring details because this is not a CV. After all, these activities have shaped me to be who I am today and give me chance to contribute to the society because, for me, human is not a reservoir of blessings but a channel to share.

Hi everyone! My name is ZHANG YUE, a year 3 student in business economics. As a member of hall 9, I joined in various hall activities as a helper or a participant, such as mid-autumn festival party, Wuddies' party, and High table dinner. By participating in these activities, I gradually feel the sense of belonging, and choose to do more for our hall. So I volunteered to become the floor representative of the eighth floor. Cooperating with other floor representatives, we have made out a plan, in order to enrich the hall lives for our floor-mates. Though participating in many activities, I still keep a good academic performance. I was awarded the Dean's List in my first year. In the following semesters, I have not lowered the standard of myself, and have kept staying in a high academic level. I am glad that I could be selected into our scholarship team to contribute more to our hall residents in academic aspect. Thank you.

<p>Hi, everyone! I am Min Chen, Minnie, a year 2 student in Computing Mathematics from Shandong. During the past academic year, I made a significant 0.3+ improvement in GPA comparing with the past and I am on the way of continuous promotion. Besides, I joined the CityU Choir and participated in the annual performance in Tsuen Wan Town Hall. In addition to joining activities such as Orientation party, Wuddies' party, residence gathering, Poon Choi Feast, Joint hall dinner and High table dinner as a member, I participated global festival, used-book sale for sedan chair donation and so on as a helper to guarantee these events going smoothly. Giving a piano performance for Poon Choi Feast also activated the atmosphere and shared the enjoyment. Being a helper and journalist for PEK competition to witness and record the excited moments also made me realize the energy and unity of Wuddies. Being mild and optimistic, I am willing to make friends with you Wuddies and do what I can to help you!</p>

<p>Hello everyone, my name is Iu Ka Wang. I am a year two student studying Civil and structure Engineering from the Architecture and Civil Engineering Department. In my first year university life, I have great passion for learning. I studied hard and eventually I got on the Dean List.
In year two, I became one of the residents in Hall 9. I like this place and want to contribute more to the residence, so I join the residence association. We organized different activities to the Wuddies and decorate our hall, we also operate the tuck shop to provide the Wuddies snacks with a lower price. We hope the residents treat Hall 9 as their second home.
I became busier after I became a RA member. I have to manage my time well in order to have a fruitful hall life and satisfying academic achievement.</p>

<p>Hi all, I am Jason. Welcome to hall 9 and it is grateful for me to introduce myself here. 
It would be quite embarrassing to mention about my academic achievement as I only got 3.5 CGPA in my first u-life. Attributing to it, I was awarded the hall scholarship and that's why I am here.
As for non-academic achievement, I am the president of an outstanding student union and I got the champion of football competition in my last secondary school-life.
Probably cosplaying Elsa for Sedan Chair funding raising activities and being interviewed are my contribution to hall 9 to which I believe I brought lots of fun. 
As I don't wanna make my self-intro to be too hard-sell myself, I would say hall 9 is the best!!! Haha!
TBH, Hall 9 bring me a homelike hall life, I am willing to contribute more to it. Thank you.</p>

Being a RA member, I coordinated with my members to organize different activities, such as Pooh Choi feast, singing contest, high table dinner, tuck shop etc. When I am on duty in tuck shop, I enjoy the moment chatting with residence.
Also, I am the one responsible for the joint hall orientation camp this year. I hope Hall9 freshmen can experience Hall9 is their second home, a place where they can feel love and caring during battling with other hall.
Lastly, thank you Hall9 for providing me a plentiful and unforgettable hall life.</p>

<p>Hello, dear Wuddies! My name is XU Tianxing, Alec, and I am a year-two student from the Department of Economics and Finance. I was just awarded with the bronze participation award by CYEP for my contribution in voluntary work and the honor of Dean's List in the last semester. During my second year living in Hall9, I was a journalist of hall media team and took part in many hall activities as well as write hall stories to record them, such as hall badminton competition, Wuddies party, etc. I also worked for the Student Resident Office as a part-time helper. In the inter-hall table tennis competition of semester A, I was a 3rd-party judge of the game by working for nearly 9 hours. Besides, being a check-in helper provided me with an opportunity to give a hand to those new residents and solve their troubles about living in halls. As a diligent and patient person, I want to contribute my efforts and intellect to assist our Wuddies in achieving greater academic performance in the coming year.</p>

<p>Hello! I am Andrew, a year-2 student major in e-Logistics and Technology Management. I love to explore new things and learn from others. Over the last two years, I enjoyed my life in Hall 9 by joining fruitful activities and spending a good time with my friends. Here I was given a lot of opportunities to train myself with different skills, such as being the decoration team leader for the Sedan Chair Race, the chief editor of the Hall Year Book and the floor representative in last year. I learnt how to manage myself and cooperate with others to achieve my maximum potential. In school, I am the student representative of my major, which I need to reflect my classmates' opinions about the courses to our major leader. All in all, Hall 9 is full of warmth and love. Everyone in here is very nice and friendly.</p>
