<p style="line-height:150%;">Residence Master is the overall in-charge of the hall. Each hall has a Residence Master who lives in the hall and has strong professional connections to the University community. The main role of the Residence Master is to provide intellectual and pastoral guidance, initiate and plan hostel activities, and cultivate a sense of community in student residence. The Residence Master is assisted by a group of Residence Tutors.</p>
