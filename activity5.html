  <h3>Visit to Kam Shan Country Park </h3>
  <div>
    <p>On November 7, 2021, the wuddies broke out of the bustling city and set out to conquer the hilly peaks of Hong Kong. Having gathered at exactly 10 am, our company of 16 people went on a hike in the Kam Shan country park. First we took the mtr to Prince Edward station and then got on the bus. After half an hour we were already standing at the dam. The weather was sunny, it was even hot. The sky was blue and almost cloudless. During the hike, we got acquainted with the local fauna: at the beginning of the way we met a wild boar, and later a large number of wild monkeys. At the beginning of the trip, we familiarized ourselves with the rules and tried not to provoke the little thieves with food or our valuables. The route we chose was the easiest - Family Walk. Together with the group, we mastered it in 2 hours or less. In addition, in order to admire the local landscapes at the beginning of the hike, the organizers announced a photography competition, so each participant tried to get bright and dynamic photos in order to get the opportunity to win ParknShop coupons. At the end of the hike, everyone was tired, but happy. Following the same route, everyone returned safely to the student residence. This SIA was remembered for the beauty of Hong Kong's nature and allowed students who became part of the Hall 9 recently to get to know each other and get to know the city a little better.

  <h3>DIY Boba Tea Workshop </h3>
  <div>
    <p> Boba tea is a Taiwanese snack, in which people add chewy tapioca balls (also known as,'boba') to milk tea. In Taiwan, this appetizer can be bought almost everywhere, ranging from small vendors in the countryside to famous restaurants. It is so important in Taiwanese people's life that this drink becomes an important culture in Taiwan.  Today, two Taiwanese residents, Cindy and Daisy, showcased this traditional snack to the Wuddies. The SIA's main objective was to teach participants how to make boba tea. First of all, we made our own boba and added it to the milk tea. To do it, we boiled water with some brown sugar, then added this boiled mixture immediately into tapioca powder. Next, mixed them, made a piece of dough out of it, and tried to give these pieces a round, pearl-like shape - 'boba-shape'. Then we boiled the 'bobas' for 15 minutes and put them in exactly when the water was boiled. Otherwise, the boba would dissolve in cool water. After that, we turned off the stove and simmered the boba for 15 minutes. Finally, the boba is ready to enjoy! Handmade 'boba' was not only chewy and delicious, most importantly, it was made of wholesome ingredients, and it was healthier than the 'boba' sold in convenient shops. Everyone enjoyed their boba tea!

  <h3>Jazz Dance Workshop </h3>
  <div>
    <p> The great dancer Martha Graham once said, 'Dance is the hidden language of the soul'. A language that speaks to everyone and unites the masses to express what they truly feel. There have been several iconic dancers through the years who have changed the world with their moves, like Michael Jackson or Patrick Swayze.  Recently, a music and dance genre has been rising and capturing the hearts of the world - Korean Pop or KPop. And we wuddies had the opportunity to learn some of it ourselves. We practiced the choreography of two songs - 'See Sea' by Korean singer Hyolyn; and, 'Left&Right' by a Korean boy group Seventeen. Both choreographies were different, but similar in the fact that it required accurate and elegant control of the body. We learnt how to isolate and use different parts of our bodies to dance using different steps, as such we learnt how impressive professional dancers are when it comes dancing with every single fibre of their bodies. As we practiced, the steps became more complex and we became more determined to master them. The guys and the girls split up to have  group vs group friendly dance competition as well. It was very clear the stiff awkward group of people that entered the room had warmed up and become loads more expressive through the power of dance. Overall, the event was a new refreshing new experience where we not only got to learn some new moves for the dance floor but also learnt a new way to express ourselves and our emotions. Everyone left that room with smiles on their faces, and probably wanting to dance for longer.

  <h3>Hall 9's Next Cooking Mama/ Papa? </h3>
  <div>
    <p> The first SIA of hall 9 'Cooking Mama/Papa' was held by the Indonesian residents. During the event, residents learned how to cook Indonesian cuisine, a stuffed fried tofu. Four groups of five cooking enthusiasts were formed and distributed over four floors. Now we will briefly introduce the recipe. First, we stir-fried some vegetables for the stuffing, such as carrots, bean sprouts, cabbage, garlic and onions. Some spices, such as turmeric and pepper, were also added into the stuffing to enhance the flavor. After that, we removed the center of tofu puffs, and stuffed the vegetables into the empty puffs. Next, we made batter using eggs, flour, water and spices; also, prepared bread crumps for breading. After dipping the delicious tofu into batter, we covered them in bread crumps and deep-fried them till turning gold and appetizing. During the event, the residents were able to become acquainted and have a pleasant conversation. Also, our new Residence Master, Denvid, participated briefly and took some photos of the residents. He introduced himself in high spirits and encouraged us to ask for help if there is any problem.  Right after preparing the dish, all the participants gathered at the 8th floor common room for a little party. The results of cooking were fantastic, the savory taste of the stuffing combined with the crispy crust of tofu puffs worked just great. Everyone had great fun and were happy to taste the authentic Indonesian snack.

  <h3>Jack-o-Lantern</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      Pumpkin carving is a long-standing Halloween tradition enjoyed by millions of people world-wide every year. The fun begins by cutting off the top of the pumpkin, from which the slimy insides are briskly scooped out. Once you have a hollowed-out form, you may begin carefully carving whatever monstrous or comical face you get inspired by. On the 28th of October, 2017, the residents of Hall 9 were lucky enough to experience this pleasure!<br/><br/> 
      Though it was hard work, everyone was well rewarded by the quirky and creative results. Many took pictures to capture the iconic event, freezing it in time forever. By the end of the night, the pumpkins got to return with their owners, casting a spooky Halloween aura in their new homes.
